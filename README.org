* Boreas

Boreas is a Sys-Admin tool focused on access control, geared towards universities.  Boreas uses a simple configuration file and will manage account creation and access for those accounts.  Boreas is proudly written in Haskell. 

** Configuration Syntax
The configuration file uses a simple syntax. 

#+begin_src cfg
universityID : GitHubUserName
#+end_src

A colon ":" is used as the delimiter between the universityID and the Github Username.  The universityID is used as the account name to be created (i.e., what a  student would login as). The GitHub username is used as the source to scrape keys from for a particular user. The relation between the universityID and GitHub username is an important one and is the basis of this tool. 

** How to install
Borease has 2 dependancies that you will have to install. 

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libgmp-dev
#+end_src
